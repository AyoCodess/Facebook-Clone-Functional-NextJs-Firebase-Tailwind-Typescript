## About

The design is based off the facebook platform.

This project was mainly used to keep my css skills sharp, get familiar with firebase and to try out nextAuth (User Authentication package)

## Features

1. Facebook, Google and Github Login enabled
2. Custom login page
3. You can share a post with or without an image and display it the UI just like Facebook
4. Your data is persisted via firebase.
5. You will only posts linked to the account you signed up with, so get posting!
6. Can now view every users post with one button click, careful what you share, because only I can delete the posts
7. Sleek design
8. Light/Dark mode
9. Mobile first approach
10. error messages for api failures (firebase quota exceeded) as this app is on the free plan

# TODOs

1. search post function by facebook name and email.
2. creating other pages in the style of facebook but repurposing them, if you have any got ideas, let me know.
